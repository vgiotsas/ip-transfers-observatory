## Cummulative port capacities

The cummulative IXP port capacities in [`cummulative-ixp-capacity/`](https://github.com/vgiotsas/ip-transfers-observatory/tree/master/cummulative-ixp-capacity) are used to infer hypergiant ASes that due to the size of their network may have a disproportionate number of IPs blacklisted.
Each line of the files with total IXP port capacities has the format `<asn> <total_port_capacity>`.

Inference of hypergiants based on IXP data is inspired by the following paper:

## ASN Population

ASN population is another attribute used in filtering ASes that may have a disproportionate number of blacklisted IPs due to their very large user base.
The number of users per ASN is in the file [autsys_population.txt](https://github.com/vgiotsas/ip-transfers-observatory/blob/master/autsys_population.txt). To compile the ASN population we use data from APNIC's aspop project which is documented below:

## Resolved Organization names to ASNs

RIRs report transfers between organizations and not ASNs. To analyze the routing behaviour of transferred IP prefixes it's useful to map the organization names to the corresponding ASNs. The file [`resolved_orgnames2asn.txt`](https://github.com/vgiotsas/ip-transfers-observatory/blob/master/resolved_orgnames2asn.txt) includes the mapping of between organization names and ASNs, for these organizations that we successfully mapped to an ASN. In many cases an organization is mapped to multiple ASNs if the organization owns multiple ASNs. 

Each line of the file has the following format: `<org_name>TAB<asn1,asn2,...>`

## Sibling ASNs

The directory `sinblings` includes pairs of ASNs that are considered to be siblings, namely they belong to the same organization.
Sibling inference is useful when analyzing IP transfers in order to understand the type of the transfer, namely if it's a transfer/acquisition or if it's a transaction between two unrelated organizations. The name of each file denotes the date of the sibling inference, for instance the file `siblings-20161001.txt` lists the siblings collected in 2016-10-01.  Each line of siblings file has the format `ASN1 ASN2` where the two ASNs are siblings.
