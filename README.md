## Cummulative port capacities

The cummulative IXP port capacities in [`cummulative-ixp-capacity/`](https://github.com/vgiotsas/ip-transfers-observatory/tree/master/cummulative-ixp-capacity) are used to infer hypergiant ASes that due to the size of their network may have a disproportionate number of IPs blacklisted.
Each line of the files with total IXP port capacities has the format `<asn> <total_port_capacity>`.

Inference of hypergiants based on IXP data is inspired by the following paper:
